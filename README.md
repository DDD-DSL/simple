A simple spring configuration based dsl lets you define microservices metadata.

Microservices adaption has picked up in recent times, whether we benefit from it is still a debatable topic,but those who do feel there is a benefit, struggle with its idiosyncrasies. 

Few of the ones I found , which I try to solve by a means of a dsl, each microservice will define, and tools and developers alike will benefit from that.
